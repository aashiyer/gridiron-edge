"""Static lat/long for each team's home stadium, keyed by team abbreviation
(same simplification used elsewhere: a team hosts at one building, so "this
team's stadium" is an adequate proxy for venue). Used to fetch weather
forecasts for upcoming games. Coordinates are approximate (stadium entrance),
which is plenty precise for a temperature/wind forecast.
